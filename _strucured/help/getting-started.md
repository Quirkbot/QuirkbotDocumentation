Weclome! Let’s start by looking at what you have in the box:

![Whats in the box]   

    QUIRKBOT: Programmable toy that connects to electronics and Strawbees
    SERVO BACKPACK: For connecting the Servo Motor to the Quirkbot
    SERVO MOTOR: This motor can move 160 degrees
    2-COLOR LEDs: Lights with 2 colors that you can attach to the Quirkbot
    LIGHT SENSOR: Sensing light for fun interaction
    STRAWBEES: For building structures with drinking straws and carboard.
    DRINKING STRAWS: Building material
    USB CABLE: For charging and programming

All the different parts of the Quirkbot it self has names check out: [the Anatomy of the Quirkbot](https://github.com/kristoferhagbard/QbDoc/blob/master/Hardware/Quirkbot_anatomy.pdf) to learn what they are.


## Build something!

Quirkbot makes it easy to make Strawbees move. A great way to get started is to just start building!

    Tools needed: Sissors and a small phillips scewdriver

To first get started with Strawbees there is a [great guide](http://www.strawbees.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/booklet_a4_small.pdf) that you also can download.

To make strawbees move you dont't have to program anything right now. Just switch on the Quirkbot and use the program that comes preloaded:

#### 5. Tips and trix to make your building more fun

- **Attach a Strawbee to your motor:** Snap on a strawbee on the back of your Servo Motors arm, like this:

![Strawbee to Motor]

- **Building a motor mount:** There are many ways to connect a Servo motor to Strawbees. Check out these discriptions for [building motor mounts]() *coming soon*

- **The straw secures the Motor arm:** When attaching a straw to the Strawbee on the Servo Motor arm, make sure to slide it over both the Strawbee *and* the Motor arm itself, like this:

- **Use other materials than straws:** Cardboard, Paper, Tape, Rubberbands, Aluinum foil and other light materials

- **Remember:** The Quirkbot Arms, Legs and Horn can be used to connect drinking straws, Just like Strawbees.

- **Inspiration:** To get some examples and inspiration for stuff to build chek out [#quirkbot on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/quirkbot/).

#### When the Quirkbot runs out of battery you need to charge it:
